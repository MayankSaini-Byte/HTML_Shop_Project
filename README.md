# HTML Basics – First Project 🚀

This repository contains my **first HTML project**, built while learning the fundamentals of web development.

I started learning HTML around **5 hours before building this project**, and the goal was to apply concepts practically instead of only following tutorials.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The project is a **simple multi-page website** for a fictional sweet shop called **“Anywhere Door-a-Cake”**.

It includes:
- A homepage with internal navigation
- A menu displayed using an HTML table
- An order form to take user input
- An about page describing the developer

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS (basic styling)**

No frameworks or libraries are used — this project focuses purely on fundamentals.

---

## ✨ Features

- Semantic HTML elements (`section`, `table`, `details`, `summary`)
- Anchor links for internal navigation
- Form inputs (text, select, number)
- Images and favicon support
- Multi-page structure (`index.html`, `about_me.html`)

## 🎯 Learning Objective

- Understand the structure of an HTML document

This is a **learning-focused project**, not a production-ready website.

- Improve styling and layout using CSS
- Make the website responsive
- Host using GitHub Pages
